# Python in Quantitative Finance
as a student majoring in Financial Mathematics, i think that python is a very useful tool to quantitative research. so i create this project to record and share what i have learned in the course and by myself.

## MAFS_5220 Quantitative and statistics analysis
In this course, I will do some homework about quantitative in python, and a final project in Machine Learning.
### Volatility Forecast in SSE&SHE with Machine Learning and Sentimental Analysis
There is a huge need for effective forecasting of financial risk, which is usually implied by the related volatility. Hence the concept of financial volatility, a required parameter for pricing many kinds of financial assets and derivatives (i.e. options), is critical. I now pursue a reasonable mathematical model to achieve efficient prediction of financial volatility. And I realized that online information can have a substantial effect on the trading price or trading volume of a stock or index. In summary, I will forecast volatility, relying partly on the sentiment analysis of online information, using a GARCH-based SVM approach.
